# HomeLab-Part-1
This a sort of a work and training journal, that encompases the creation of a little server of my own, for my own testing and training.


Ok here is the initial plan. I have an oldie laptop. It is not special but it is mine. So it is not doing much at the moment. I would like to use it for work but unfortunately I don't think it is very comfortable for me to use (Tall people problems). However I need to be able to return it to working condition pretty quick. So here is the plan: 

1. Take the laptop and snapshot it to an USB - that way I have a working back up to return to. 
2. Erase its internal SSD. 
3. Install Proxmox.
4. Spin up a VM using Terraform.
5. Use Ansible as a configuration manager to ensure the image on there is good.
6. Have a Dev VM I can SSH into.
7. Have a series of containers for Docker and Kubernates labs in the future.

Things to include - notes from the learning process.
